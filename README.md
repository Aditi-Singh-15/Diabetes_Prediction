# Diabetes Prediction Project Report

## Project Overview

Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early prediction and diagnosis can lead to better management and treatment options. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various health metrics collected from individuals. The model is built using the PIMA Indian Diabetes Database and employs a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for accurate predictions.

## Live Demo

You can try out the live demo of the Diabetes Prediction Web App [here](https://diabetesprediction-drdrh46xm6nyx4mcidm9b6.streamlit.app/).

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-prediction
2. **Install the Required Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt


## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app provides an intuitive interface for users to input their health metrics.
- **Predictive Model**: Uses a trained SVM classifier to predict diabetes based on user inputs.
- **Data Standardization**: Input data is standardized to ensure accurate predictions.
- **Clear Output**: The app clearly communicates whether the user is likely diabetic or not based on the prediction.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for developing the application.
- **Streamlit**: A framework for building interactive web applications with Python.
- **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library for Python that provides tools for model training and evaluation.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computations in Python.
